# Mapping Heat Risk and Vulnerable Populations in African Cities: A Case Study of Lagos, Nigeria

## Project Overview

This project analyzes urban heat exposure and its intersection with vulnerable populations using geospatial data. The workflow focuses on Lagos, Nigeria as a case study and can be adapted for other African cities.

Key objectives:

* Map Land Surface Temperature (LST) patterns using satellite data.

* Identify female population (15â€“49) exposure to high heat levels.
  
* Provide visualizations and metrics to support climate adaptation and urban planning.
